--> Sublime build without use of adding input output paths ( #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE ....) in the code .
<br>
--> My cp template with debugger to debug various variables like int, ll , vector, map, string etc .
<br>
Make a error.txt file in the same directory as the input and output file and debug your code with ease .
